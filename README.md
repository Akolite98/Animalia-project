An animal Parent class was created which all the classes inherited from to avoid re-implementing the same functionality.
After creating the Parent class, I created other two sub classes from which I classfied them.
The picture indicated animals but also indicated two major classes of animals which are vertebrates and invertebrates .

The constructor in the parent class is #Name and #gender because those two applies to all the animals.

The two sub classes also have a number of animals under it but those animals inherits boths from the Animal class and the vertebrate and invertebrate sub classes

# Expected Output
